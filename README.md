# 🏏 IPL Cricket Data Analysis using Machine Learning

This project performs in-depth analysis of IPL (Indian Premier League) data using Python, Pandas, and visualization libraries. It focuses on team strategies, player performance, and match statistics. The analysis helps in extracting insights and patterns using real match data.

---

## 📁 Datasets Used
- matches.csv: Contains match-level information (season, venue, winner, toss, etc.)
- deliveries.csv: Ball-by-ball delivery details (batsman, bowler, runs, dismissals, etc.)

Both datasets are sourced from [Kaggle IPL Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python (Jupyter / Google Colab)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (if ML model is applied)

---

## 🔍 Features Covered
- Total matches per season and winners
- Most successful teams and players
- Toss analysis: Does winning toss impact match result?
- Run rate comparisons
- Player strike rate and economy analysis
- Top scorers, wicket-takers, consistent performers
- (Optional) Match outcome prediction using machine learning
